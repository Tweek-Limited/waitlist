                            I initiated this endeavor with the intention of maintaining simplicity. I firmly believe that genuine learning occurs through active conversations rather than in the confines of a classroom, where the repetition of words by a teacher with limited real-world exposure can be limiting. This platform aims to create a collaborative community where students can collectively share their knowledge.
